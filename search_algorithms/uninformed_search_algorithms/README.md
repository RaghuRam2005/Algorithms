### Uninformed Search Algorithms

Uninformed search is a class of general-purpose algorithms which operates in brute-force way. Uninformed search algorithms do not have additional inofrmation about state or search space other than how to traverse the tree, so it is called as blind search.

#### Types of Uninformed search Algorithms:

1. Breadth - first search (BFS)
2. Depth - first search (DFS)
3. Uniform cost search (UCS)
4. Iterative deepening depth first search (ITDDFS)
