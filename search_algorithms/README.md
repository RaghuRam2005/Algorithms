### Search Algorithms

Searching is fundamental process of locating a specific element or item within collection of data.

### Types of search Algorithms:
- Uninformed search:
  -  Breadth first search
  - Depth first search
  - Uniform cost search
  - Iterative deepening depth first search

- Informed Search:
  - A * search
  - Greedy Breadth first search

- Adversarial Search:
  - Alfa Beta algorithm
  - Min Max Algorithm
